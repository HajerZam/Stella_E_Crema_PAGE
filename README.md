# ☕ Stella & Crema — Coffee Shop Website (Concept Demo)
---

**Stella & Crema** is a fictional coffee brand created to showcase my front-end design and web development capabilities.  
This responsive one-page site highlights modern UI/UX principles, interactive components, and clean code architecture using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is part of my personal portfolio. It's not a real business — just a crafted experience to demonstrate:

- Visual design consistency (branding, typography, color palette)
- Responsive layouts with Tailwind CSS
- DOM scripting and interactive features (e.g., shopping cart)
- Attention to modern front-end best practices

- 📱 **Responsive Design** — Mobile-first layout, grid-based structure
- 🛒 **Functional Cart UI** — Add, remove, and update product quantities
- 🎨 **Cohesive Color Palette** — Inspired by warm, creamy café tones
- 💬 **Blog Section** — Stylized content blocks for storytelling
